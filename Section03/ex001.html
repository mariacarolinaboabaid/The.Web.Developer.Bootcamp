    <!--HEAD TITLE-->
    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <!--TEXT-->
    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster</b> or <b>cock</b> is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a <b>cockerel</b>. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a <b>hen</b> and a sexually immature female is called a <b>pullet</b>.</p>

    <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).<sup>[2][3]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[4]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.<sup>[5]</sup> There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,<sup>[6]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[8][9][10]</sup></p>

    <!--SECOND TITLE-->
    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <!--MORE TEXT-->
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.<sup>[28]</sup> In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,<sup>[29]</sup> or sometimes young mice.<sup>[30]</sup></p>

    <p>The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.<sup>[31]</sup> The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.<sup>[32]</sup></p>

    <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.<sup>[33]</sup></p>

    <h3>Behaviour</h3>

    <!-- 1º FOURTH TITLE-->
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <!--MORE TEXT-->
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<sup>[34]</sup></p>

    <!--2º FOURTH TITLE-->
    <h4>Vocalizations</h3>
    <!--MORE TEXT-->
    <p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>

    <p>A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.<sup>[35] </sup>However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.</p>

    <p>Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.<sup>[36]</sup></p>
